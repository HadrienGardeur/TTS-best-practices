# Voice Selection

When selecting a voice, the following criteria need to be considered:

- [offline availability](#offline-availability)
- [language and regional preferences](#language-and-regional-preferences)
- [voice quality](#voice-quality)
- along with [various other traits](#other-traits)

**Recommendations:**

- Reading applications should implement smart defaults that follow the criteria documented in this page.
- But users should always be free to select the voice that they prefer.
- A voice list should ideally be filtered based on some of these criteria as well, to avoid displaying hundreds of voices to the user.


## Offline availability

On most platforms, the best voices tend to require an online connection to manage the playback of an utterance.

While this can be great for the overall listening experience, relying strictly on online voices can be problematic:

- Users can be temporarily offline, which would restrict their ability to use the read aloud feature.
- If they're on a limited data plan, this could trigger additional costs or block the read aloud feature once the data cap has been reached.
- In an environment with a very high latency, the use of online voices could negatively impact the overall experience.

The following APIs return information about offline availability:

- On the Web, [`getVoices()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis/getVoices) returns this information reliably in the [`localService`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisVoice/localService) key for each voice.
- On Android, this information is available as a method for [each voice](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/speech/tts/Voice) using [`isNetworkConnectionRequired()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/speech/tts/Voice#isNetworkConnectionRequired()). In addition, voices also include an estimated network latency (with 5 different values, from very low to very high).

In native apps on Apple devices, this informations is missing [from the fields describing a voice](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avspeechsynthesisvoice#2857908) since all voices are available offline (as long as they have been downloaded).

**Recommendations:**

- Users should be able to easily identify and/or filter voices that require a connection.
- If an application defaults to an online voice, it should also fallback automatically to an offline voice without requiring additional user input.
- Users should be free to easily disable all online voices, which should impact the default voice and the list of voices displayed to the user.
- ðŸ’¡Should we also recommend a fallback to an offline voice if the user selected an online voice? If not, should the application warn the user that their preferred voice is unavailable offline?

## Language and regional preferences

[Extracting a base language for an EPUB](https://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/epub/language.html#publication-lang) can be surprisingly difficult:

- There's no difference between primary and secondary languages in its metadata which means that a bilingual publication (let's say in English and Spanish) can end up with the same metadata than an English publication with just a few paragraphs in Spanish.
- The order in which languages are listed isn't meaningful, but reading applications still need a rule to select a base language (usually the first language listed in its metadata).

ðŸ’¡Should we also cover the equivalent metadata for PDF?

While this base language and the language of each utterance can contain regional information, it's also important for reading applications to consider user preferences when listing voices or selecting a default voice.

On all platforms, language and regional preferences can be obtained through the following APIs:

- On the Web, this informations is provided by the browser to a remote server using the [`Accept-Language`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) header in HTTP and an ordered list of [BCP 47 language tags](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646) (`en-US` for example). Web apps can also access this information using [`navigator.languages`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/languages).
- On Android, the [`Locale`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale) class can be called to return this information. Applications can have their own language setting in recent versions of Android, but it's best to use system settings instead since they can return multiple languages and/or regions.

**Recommendations:**

- Reading applications should use the first language listed in `dc:language` as the base language of the publication.
- This base language must be overriden per utterance, [based on additional information extracted from the content](https://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/epub/language.html#lang-override).
- Since the base language can be missing or incorrectly documented, it's important to allow the user to override this information as well.
- When selecting a default voice for a language, applications should follow regional preferences returned by these APIs using the full list rather than the first language only.
- If an application cannot match these preferences, it should rely on language-specific fallbacks rules. For example, if the device is set to `fr-BE` (French from Belgium) but there isn't a single voice available for Belgium, it could fallback to `fr-FR` (French from France) instead.
